# SelfDirectedAssignment
Uni Assignment(Shop Application)

Hello, first time doing one of these. This is was a first year project for my programming module. Its fairly simple but I'm looking to expand it and learn as I go along
so I would appreciate any feedback and improvements!


1. What is this?

This is a terminal shop application that allows users to buy, sell and check prices and stocks of products. Currently I'm revamping it using Arraylists to allow users
to add new products.

Initially this was mainly a project to demonstrate the use for classes, arrays and other java concepts, It's gone slightly beyond that since then.
